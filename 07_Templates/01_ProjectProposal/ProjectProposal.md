# 1. Introduction

Einordnung des Dokuments

The management bases the decision to approve a project within the scope of a Project Progress Decision of the Decision Gate Project Approved on the project proposal, which is not prepared within the framework of the V-Model. Based on a project or system idea, the acquirer systematically describes the necessity of a project based on feasibility, affordability, market, and economic efficiency criteria. The project proposal processes subjects like the initial situation, existing framework conditions, project objectives and system concepts, chances and risks, and the economic efficiency.

All written text in this color is explanatory and has to be deleted when the document is released. The example given here is only a skeleton. Your text has to be more elaborate and explanatory.

Mit unseren Projekt "Food Scanner" kann man mit einer Kamera, die an einen Raspberry Pi angeschlossen ist, Nahrungsmittel scannen und überprüfen, ob diese Gesundheitsfördernd sind oder nicht. Immer mehr Leute sind sich indessen nicht bewusst, welche Lebensmittel ungesund sind und deswegen wollen wir dieser Krise, mit diesem geilen Produkt, den Kampf ansagen.

# 2. Initial Situation

The initial situation presents the **assessment of the actual situation** of an organizational unit or the entire organization of an agency or company. Thus a need for action, which may lead to a product or system vision, is recognizable. The vision may be developed into a project idea. The need for action may be initiated by several project or system ideas.

The demonstration of capability gaps (i.e. the difference between the necessary planned capabilities and the actually existing capabilities) in a company or agency may clearly show an urgent need for action in order to increase the efficiency or reduce costs. This need for action is presented as product or system idea, leading frequently to a concrete project proposal. Corresponsingly, the determination of the requirement to renew or improve a &quot;technically obsolete&quot; system (so-called &quot;system regeneration&quot;) or the recognition of market chances for a new product or system may lead to a project idea. The applicable data must be developed for the project proposal.

Research programs or studies may also be the basis for project ideas; they will be concretized in a project proposal.

In der Ausgangslage werden beispielsweise folgende Informationen und Daten der zu untersuchenden Organisationseinheit im Hinblick auf die Projektidee beschrieben:

● Die Ist-Fähigkeiten der Organisation (was können wir?)

● Die Soll-Fähigkeiten der Organisation (was wollen wir können?)

● Ein Soll-Ist-Fähigkeitenvergleich (wo liegen die Defizite?)

● Ein Fähigkeitsvergleich nach vorgegebenen Bewertungskriterien

● Eine Skizze der Projektidee

The initial situation presents the assessment of the actual situation of an organi- zational unit or the entire organization of an agency or company. Thus a need for action, which may lead to a product or system vision, is recognizable. The vision may be developed into a project idea. The need for action may be initiated by several project or system ideas. The demonstration of capability gaps (i.e. the difference between the necessary planned capabilities and the actually existing capabilities) in a company or agency may clearly show an urgent need for action in order to in- crease the efficiency or reduce costs. This need for action is presented as product or system idea, leading frequently to a concrete project proposal. Correspondingly, the determination of the requirement to renew or improve a &quot;technically obsolete&quot; system (so-called &quot;system regeneration&quot;) or the recognition of market chances for a new product or system may lead to a project idea. The applicable data must be de- veloped for the project proposal. Research programs or studies may also be the basis for project ideas; they will be concretized in a project proposal.

The basic question could be summarized in German as follows:

• Die Ist-Fähigkeiten der Organisation (was können wir?)

• Die Soll-Fähigkeiten der Organisation (was wollen wir können?)

• Ein Soll-Ist-Fähigkeitenvergleich (wo liegen die Defizite?)

• Ein Fähigkeitsvergleich nach vorgegebenen Bewertungskriterien

Example:

_A doctor in a (primary) school examines the primary school students periodically. (S)he must report the results of this examinations and inform parents about medical defects. Sometimes the doctor has to refer students in problematic health condition to specialists._

_The creation of the paperwork is time-consuming since the health data collected during the examinations has to be edited several times (once for the reports, once for the parents information, once for referral, etc. The information retrieval concerning the medical history of students is also time-consuming. The time spent on this work would be better used on direct contact time with students._

_The documentation of the examinations can be automated. So the reports and further documents will be generated. The medical history will be persisted automatically._

# 3. General Conditions and Constraints

example

This subject describes the framework conditions to be observed by all stakeholders when the project idea is implemented into concrete measures for realizing the system. Framework conditions, e.g., budget situation, existing know-how, legal provisions, cooperations, commitment to partners and deadlines, may be turned into specifica- tions for project execution. Technical framework conditions, e.g., development en- vironments and platforms, IT infrastructure, applicable standards and regulations, or specifications of off-the-shelf products, lead to additional (non-functional) require- ments for system development.

Example:

- _The information about the medical condition of the pupils is strictly confidential._
- _The GUI of the information system must be intuitive._
- _The application must have a small footprint and a local database._
- _A backup concept is mandatory_
- _The application is multi-language capable (english and german)_

# 4. Project Objectives and System Concepts

In the Subject Project Objectives and System Concepts, the acquirer describes his vision of a new project or system on a high abstraction level. Project objectives and system concepts may concern several aspects, e.g., the introduction of innovations, the definition of objectives (quality, deadline and cost objectives), the operation of the system in its operating environment and the use of new, improved functionalities.

example

Example:

_The project objectives can be summarized as follows:_

• _The doctor is documenting the examination results while examining the students_

• _Input form assists her/him to input information in a structured and easy way_

• _Common situations (need for vaccinations, check for need of dental brace, etc.) are a one-click-job for the doctor_

• _Info sheet for parents can be printed right after examination_

• _Report is a one-click-job at the end of the day_

# 5. Opportunities and Risks

The Subject Opportunities and Risks comprises data which are normally prepared in industrial business plans. Frequently, an anonymous market with potential acquirers, which could be interested in the new product or system idea, will be analyzed at first. Therefore, the contents of this subject is characterized by a certain uncertainty or fuzziness. The subjects examines the chances of achieving profit on the market with a specific product or system. In addition to the chances, the risks of failing on the market or sustaining losses with a product or system should be analyzed.

Example:

_The project has the following opportunities:_

• _The doctor is able to increase his time with his patients._

• _The time for bureaucratic work declines._

• _The quality will increase_

_The following risk have to be taken into account._

• _Data transfer of students&#39; master data from legacy systems is problematic._

• _There is no information about the legacy systems and their data structure._

• _Further there is no information, whether the staff is capable and willing to supply the students master data (names, classes, ...)._
